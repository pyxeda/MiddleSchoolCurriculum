What it does :

    1. This code reads a csv file, trains a knn regression model on the dataset and then calculates the MAE and RMSE metrics.

Dependancies :

    1. sklearn module is needed to be installed in the local machine.

    2. pandas module is needed to be installed in the local machine, to read CSV.

    3. gdown module is needed to be installed in the local machine, to download the CSV file from the google drive. 


Things to check before running :

    1. Check whether you have given the correct file location of the csv file. 

    2. Check whether you have access to the file. 

    3. Check whether the file format is correct.
