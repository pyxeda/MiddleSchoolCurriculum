What it does :

    1. Calculates the root mean square error between two lists, AI predictions and the labels.

        a. Without using libraries

        b. Using libraries

Dependancies :

    1. sklearn module is needed to be installed in the local machine to calculate mean squared error.

Things to check before running :

    1. Check whether you have given valid elements for the 2 lists.

    2. Check whether your lists are not empty.

    3. Check whether the two lists have same number of elements.
