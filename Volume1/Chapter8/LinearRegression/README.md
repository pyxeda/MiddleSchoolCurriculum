What it does :

    1. This code reads a csv file and creates a linear regression model (using scikit learn). Then, it evaluates its performance using MAE and RMSE metrics.

Dependancies :

    1. sklearn module is needed to be installed in the local machine.
    
    2. pandas module is needed to be installed in the local machine, to read CSV.

    3. gdown module is needed to be installed in the local machine, to download the CSV file from the google drive. 


Things to check before running :

    1. Check whether you have given the correct file location of the csv file. 

    2. Check whether you have access to the file. 

    3. Check whether the file format is correct.
