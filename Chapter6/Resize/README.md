What it does :

    1. Reads an image from the google drive, then resize the image to a fixed size and, finally displays both images.

Dependancies :

    1. OpenCV(cv2) module is needed to be installed in the local machine, for the image processing.

    2. gdown module is needed to be installed in the local machine, to download the image file from the google drive. 


Things to check before running :

    1. Check whether you have given the correct file location of the image. 

    2. Check whether you have access to the file. 

    3. Check whether the file format is correct.
