What it does :

Read data from CSV files, and plot histograms and bar plots of selected data columns

    1. Histogram is plotted for a selected column

    2. Bar graph is plotted for 2 columns 

Dependancies :

Dependancies are needed to read CSV files, visualise plots, and to get the path of the working directory

    1. pandas module is needed to be installed in the local machine, to read the CSV file and to process the tabular data.

    2. matplotlib module is needed to be installed in the local machine, for the visualization. 

    3. os module is a part of the standard library. 

Things to check before running :

    1. Check whether you have given the correct name of your csv file.

    2. Check whether you have given correct column names for the data visualization. (you can check the column names from the 'Details of the dataset' displayed in the terminal, once you execute the program)
