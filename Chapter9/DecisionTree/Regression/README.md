What it does :

    1. Reads a csv file from the google drive, then create a decision tree regressor model on the average dataset. Visualize the tree. Calculate RMSE and MAE.

Dependancies :

    1. sklearn module is needed to be installed in the local machine.

    2. pandas module is needed to be installed in the local machine.

    3. matplotlib module is needed to be installed in the local machine.

    4. gdown module is needed to be installed in the local machine, to download the CSV file from the google drive. 


Things to check before running :

    1. Check whether you have given the correct file location of the csv file. 

    2. Check whether you have access to the file. 

    3. Check whether the file format is correct.
