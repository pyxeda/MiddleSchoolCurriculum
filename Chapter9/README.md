This folder include all the python code examples related to Chapter 9: Decision tree and Random forest models

DecisionTree    ->  

    Classification  ->   Create a decision tree model (using scikit-learn) on the child vs adult dataset (classification). Visualize the tree. Calculate the accuracy and confusion matrix.

    Regression      ->   Create a decision tree model (using scikit-learn) on the averages dataset (regression). Visualize the tree. Calculate RMSE and MAE

RandomForst     ->  

    Classification  ->   Create a random forest model (using scikit-learn) on the child vs adult dataset (classification). Visualize one of the trees. Calculate the accuracy and confusion matrix

    Regression      ->   Create a random forest model (using scikit-learn) on the averages dataset (regression). Visualize one of the trees. Calculate RMSE and MAE.
