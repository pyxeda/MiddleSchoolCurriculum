What it does :

Read CSV files from google drive, and plot histograms and bar plots of selected data columns

    1. Histogram is plotted for a selected column

    2. Bar graph is plotted for 2 columns 

Dependancies :

    1. pandas module is needed to be installed in the local machine, to read the CSV file and to process the tabular data.

    2. matplotlib module is needed to be installed in the local machine, for the visualization. 

    3. gdown module is needed to be installed in the local machine, to download the image file from the google drive. 


Things to check before running :

    1. Check whether you have given the correct name of your csv file.

    2. Check whether your file format is correct.

    3. Check whether you have access to the file.

    4. Check whether you have given correct column names for the data visualization. (you can check the column names from the 'Details of the Dataset' displayed in the terminal, once you execute the program)
